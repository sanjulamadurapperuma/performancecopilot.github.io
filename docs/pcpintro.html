               <p>
                The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open source toolkit designed for monitoring and managing system-level performance.  These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate the most complex system configurations and performance problems.
               </p>
               <p>
                PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, IRIX, Solaris and Windows (Win32).  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:

                 </i>
                 .  These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the kernel or a database.  These are available from

                 </i>
                 .  These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of PCP.  Other monitoring tools are available separately, such as pmchart, in layered packages that build on the core PCP functionality.

                The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being  monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (

                   </b>
                   option may be used to force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a natural time unit.  For example

                   To specify an offset from the current time (in real time mode) or the beginning of a PCP archive (in archive mode) simply specify the interval of time as the argument.  For example

                For any missing low order fields, the default value of 0 is assumed for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month and Jan for months.  Hence, the following are equivalent:
                <i>
                 -S ’@ Mar 1996’
                </i>
                and
                <i>
                 -S ’@ Mar 1 00:00:00 1996’.
                </i>
               </p>
               <p>
                If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by starting with the year, month and day from the current time (real time mode) or the time at the beginning of the PCP archive log (archive mode) and advancing the time until it matches the fields that are specified.  So, for example if the time window starts by default at "Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996", then
                <i>
                 -S @13:10
                </i>
                corresponds to 13:10:00 on Mon Mar 4, 1996, while
                <i>
                 -S @10:00
                </i>
                corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue Mar 5, 1996 (note this is the following day).

               <p>
                The number of performance metric names supported by PCP in IRIX is of the order of a few thousand.  There are fewer metrics on Linux, but still a considerable number.  The PCP libraries and applications use an internal identification scheme that unambiguously associates a single integer with each known performance metric.  This integer is known as the Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID.  Although not a requirement, PMIDs tend to have global consistency across all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has the same PMID.
               </p>
               <p>
                For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be inappropriate (e.g. this would limit the range of accessible metrics, make the code hard to maintain, force the user interface to be particularly baroque, etc.).  Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is used to provide external names and a hierarchic classification for performance metrics.  A PMNS is represented as a tree, with each node having a label, a pointer to either a PMID (for leaf nodes) or a set of descendent nodes in the PMNS (for non-leaf nodes).
               </p>
               <p>
                A node label must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by zero or more characters drawn from the alphabetics, the digits and character `_´ (underscore).  For alphabetic characters in a node label, upper and lower case are distinguished.
               </p>
               <p>
                By convention, the name of a performance metric is constructed by concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS from the root node to a leaf node, with a ‘‘.’’ as a separator.  The root node in the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label associated with one of the descendent nodes below the root node of the PMNS, e.g.
                <i>
                 kernel.percpu.syscall
                </i>
                .  Typically (although this is not a requirement) there would be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS.  For example
                <i>
                 kernel.all.cpu.idle
                </i>
                and
                <i>
                 disk.dev.read
                </i>
                are the unique names for two distinct performance metrics, each with a unique PMID.
               </p>
               <p>
                Groups of related PMIDs may be named by naming a non-leaf node in the PMNS tree, e.g.
                <i>
                 disk
                </i>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                There may be PMIDs with no associated name in a PMNS; this is most likely to occur when specific PMIDs are not available in all systems, e.g. if ORACLE is not installed on a system, there is no good reason to pollute the PMNS with names for all of the ORACLE performance metrics.
               </p>
               <p>
                Note also that there is no requirement for the PMNS to be the same on all systems, however in practice most applications would be developed against a stable PMNS that was assumed to be a subset of the PMNS on all systems.  Indeed the PCP distribution includes a default local PMNS for just this purpose.
               </p>
               <p>
                The default local PMNS is located at $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root however the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will then be used as the default local PMNS.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most applications do not use the local PMNS, but rather import parts of the PMNS as required from the same place that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from
                <b>
                 pmcd
                </b>

               <p>
                To explore the PMNS use

                 pmcd
                </b>
                (1) and PCP archives.  The version number is used in a number of ways, but most noticeably for the distributed pmns(5).  In PCP version 1, the client applications would load the PMNS from the default PMNS file but in PCP version 2, the client applications extract the PMNS information from
                <b>
                 pmcd
                </b>
                or a PCP archive.  Thus in PCP version 2, the version number is used to determine if the PMNS to use is from the default local file or from the actual current source of the metrics.

                   <b>
                    PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
                   </b>
                   in the environment to a real number of seconds for the desired timeout.  This is most useful in cases where the remote host is at the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to establish the connection correctly.

                   (1), the connection may be re-established by calling a service routine in the PCP library.  However, attempts to reconnect are controlled by a back-off strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection requests.  By default, the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 seconds for consecutive reconnection requests from a client (the last delay will be repeated for any further attempts after the fifth).  Setting the environment variable

                   Many of the performance metrics exported from PCP agents have the semantics of

                    counter

                   meaning they are expected to be monotonically increasing.  Under some circumstances, one value of these metrics may be less than the previously fetched value.  This can happen when a counter of finite precision overflows, or when the PCP agent has been reset or restarted, or when the PCP agent is exporting values from some underlying instrumentation that is subject to some asynchronous discontinuity.
