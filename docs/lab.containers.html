                Container engines like Docker, LXC, Rocket and others build on
              two Linux kernel facilities -
                <b>
                 cgroups
                </b>
                and
                <b>
                 namespaces
                </b>
                .
              In order to understand the performance characteristics of containerized
              environments, we need some background kernel knowledge to see how these
              concepts affect both the system itself, and system-level analysis tools
              like PCP.
               </p>

                This tutorial aims to build or refresh your knowledge in these areas,
              while at the same time showing you how to extract performance data from
              individual containers using the PCP tools.

                Creating and administering containers is the job of a container runtime
              engine, and each operates differently.
              If you don't have some handy already, create and start one or two containers
              for experimentation - the steps involved are widely documented, and differ
              differ between engines, so we will skip over them here.

                Control Groups are a Linux kernel mechanism for aggregating
              or partitioning sets of tasks, and their children, into hierarchical
              groups with specialized behaviour.
              This is the underlying technology used for controlling the set of
              processes within each container.
               </p>
               <p>
                Recall that the concept of a "container" is a user-space
              construct only, and it is the role of the container engine to ensure
              the kernel cgroup hierarchies are constructed and managed appropriately
              for the containers it provides.
               </p>
               <p>
                A cgroup
                <b>
                 subsystem
                </b>
                is kernel code that makes use of the task
              grouping facilities provided by cgroups to treat groups of tasks in
              particular ways.  A subsystem is typically a "resource controller" that
              schedules a resource or applies per-cgroup limits.  Examples of cgroup
              subsystems used by container engines include the virtual memory subsystem
              (
                <i>
                 memory
                </i>
                ), the processor accounting subsystem (
                <i>
                 cpuacct
                </i>
                ),
              the block accounting cgroup (
                <i>
                 blkio
                </i>
                ), and several others.
               </p>
               <p>
                Within the scope of individual cgroup subsystems, hierarchies
              can be created, managed and shaped in terms of the tasks within them.
              A

                 hierarchy
                </b>
                is a set of cgroups arranged in a tree, such that
              every task in the system is in exactly one of the cgroups in the
              hierarchy, and a set of subsystems; each

                 subsystem
                </i>
                has
              system-specific state attached to each cgroup in the hierarchy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Each hierarchy has an instance of the cgroup virtual filesystem
              associated with it.

                Userspace code (i.e. container engines like Docker and LXC) can
              create and destroy cgroups by name in an instance of the cgroup
              virtual file system, specify and query to which cgroup a task is
              assigned, and list the task PIDs assigned to a cgroup.
              Those creations and assignments only affect the hierarchy associated
              with that instance of the cgroup file system.

                Completely distinct to cgroups, at least within the kernel, is the
              concept of
                <i>
                 namespaces
                </i>
                .
              Namespaces allow different processes to have differing views of several
              aspects of the kernel, such as the hostname (UTS namespace), network
              interfaces (NET namespace), process identifiers (PID namespace), mounted
              filesystems (MNT namespace) and so on.
               </p>
               <p>
                When processes share a namespace, they share the same view of a resource.
              For example, objects created in one IPC namespace are visible to all other
              processes that are members of that namespace, but are not visible to
              processes having another IPC namespace.
              So for our purposes, all processes running in one container can thus have
              a different view to the IPC resources visible to a process running on the
              host or a different container.
               </p>
               <p>
                Returning to the first networking example in this tutorial, we can see
              how namespaces become important from a performance tooling point of view.
              For network metrics within a container, we want to be able to report values
              for the set of network interfaces visible within that container, instead of
              the set from the host itself.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finally, it is important to note that namespaces are not a complete
              abstraction, in that many aspects of the underlying host remain visible
              from within the container.  This affects performance tools in that the
              values exported for some metrics can be adjusted and fine-tuned relative
              to the container, while others cannot.

                All connections made to the PCP metrics collector daemon (
                <i>
                 pmcd
                </i>
                )
              are made using the PCP protocol, which is TCP/IP based and thus
              (importantly for containers) connection-oriented.
              Each individual monitoring tool has a unique connection to
                <i>
                 pmcd
                </i>
                and can request values for a specific, custom set of metrics. This includes
              being able to request metric values related to a specific, named container.
              Note that PCP differs to the design of several other monitoring systems
              in this regard, which write or send out a specified set of system-wide
              values, on a set interval.
               </p>
               <p>
                From a user point of view, this boils down to being able to specify a
              container via the interface (whether command line or graphical) of the
              PCP monitoring tools and to have that container name transfered to the
              PCP collector system.  This allows for filtering and fine-tuning of the
              metric values it returns, such that the values are specific to the named
              container.

                Support for containers was first added in the 3.10.2 version of PCP
              (released in January 2015).
              This version includes the

                It performs privileged operations on behalf of other PCP agents and plays
              a pivotal role in informing the other agents about various attributes of the
              active containers that it discovers on the PCP collector system.
