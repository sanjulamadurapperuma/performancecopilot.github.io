 <h2>
  DESCRIPTION
 </h2>
 These shell scripts and associated control files may be used to
create a customized regime of administration and management for
Performance Co-Pilot (see
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/pcpintro.1.html">
   PCPintro
  </a>
 </b>
 (1))

archive log files.
 <p>
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  is intended to be run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as
soon after midnight as practicable.
Its task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping one or more sets of PCP archives.
 </p>
 <p>
  After some period, old PCP archives are discarded.
This period is 14 days by default, but may be changed using the
  <b>
   -k
  </b>
  option.
Some special values are recognized for the period (
  <i>
   discard
  </i>
  ),

namely
  <b>
   0
  </b>
  to keep no archives beyond the current one, and
  <b>
   forever
  </b>
  or
  <b>
   never
  </b>
  to prevent any archives being discarded.
Note that the semantics of
  <i>
   discard
  </i>
  are that it is measured from the time of last modification of each
archive, and not from the current day.
This has subtle implications for compression (see below) - the
compression process results in the creation of new archive files
which have new modification times.
In this case, the
  <i>
   discard
  </i>
  period (re)starts from the time of compression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Archive data files can optionally be compressed after some period
to conserve disk space.
This is particularly useful for large numbers of
  <b>
   pmlogger
  </b>
  processes under the control of
  <b>
   pmlogger_check
  </b>
  .

If
  <b>
   transparent_decompress
  </b>
  is enabled when
  <i>
   libpcp
  </i>
  was built
(can be checked with
  <b>
   pmconfig
  </b>
  <b>
   -L
  </b>
  ),

then the default behaviour is compression ``as soon as possible''
otherwise the default behaviour is to
  <b>
   not
  </b>
  compress files (which matches the historical default behaviour
in earlier PCP releases).
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -x
  </b>
  option controls compression and
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  specifies the number of days after which to compress archive data
files and metadata files.
If
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  is
  <b>
   0
  </b>
  then compression will be applied as soon as possible.
If
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  is
  <b>
   never
  </b>
  or
  <b>
   forever
  </b>
  then no compression will be done.
The environment variable
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSAFTER
  </b>
  may be used as an alternative mechanism to define
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  .

If both
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSAFTER
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   -x
  </b>
  specify different values for
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  then the environment variable value is used and a warning is issued.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -X
  </b>
  option specifies the program to use for compression - by default this is
  <b>
   <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xz.1.html">
    xz
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).

The environment variable
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESS
  </b>
  may be used as an alternative mechanism to define
  <i>
   program
  </i>
  .

If both
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESS
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   -X
  </b>
  specify different compression programs
then the environment variable value is used and a warning is issued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use of the
  <b>
   -Y
  </b>
  option allows a regular expression to be specified causing files in
the set of files matched for compression to be omitted - this allows
only the data file to be compressed, and also prevents the program from
attempting to compress it more than once.  The default
  <i>
   regex
  </i>
  is ".(index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4)$" - such files are
filtered using the
  <b>
   -v
  </b>
  option to
  <b>
   <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/egrep.1.html">
    egrep
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).

The environment variable
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSREGEX
  </b>
  may be used as an alternative mechanism to define
  <i>
   regex
  </i>
  .

If both
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSREGEX
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   -Y
  </b>
  specify different values for
  <i>
   regex
  </i>
  then the environment variable value is used and a warning is issued.
 </p>
 <p>
  To accommodate the evolution of PMDAs and changes in production
logging environments,
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  is integrated with
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">
    pmlogrewrite
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

to allow optional and automatic rewriting of archives before merging.
If there are global rewriting rules to be applied across all archives
mentioned in the control file(s), then create the directory
  <b>
   $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite
  </b>
  and place any
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">
    pmlogrewrite
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

rewriting rules in this directory.
For rewriting rules that are specific to only one family of archives,
use the directory name from the control file(s) - i.e. the
  <i>
   fourth
  </i>
  field - and create a file, or a directory, or a symbolic link named
  <b>
   pmlogrewrite
  </b>
  within this directory
and place the required rewriting rule(s) in the
  <b>
   pmlogrewrite
  </b>
  file or in files
within the
  <b>
   pmlogrewrite
  </b>
  subdirectory.
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  will choose rewriting rules from the archive directory if they
exist, else rewriting rules from
  <b>
   $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite
  </b>
  if that directory exists, else no rewriting is attempted.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -r
  </b>
  command line option acts as an over-ride and
prevents all archive rewriting with
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">
    pmlogrewrite
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

independent of the presence of any rewriting rule files or directories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes PMDA changes require
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  archives to be rewritten,
not just the ones involved
in any current merging.
This is required for example after a PCP upgrade where a new version of an
existing PMDA has revised metadata.
The
  <b>
   -R
  </b>
  command line forces this universal-style of rewriting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -R
  </b>
  option to
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  is mutually exclusive with both the
  <b>
   -r
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   -M
  </b>
  options.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an alternate mechanism, if the file
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite
  </b>
  exists when
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  starts then this is treated the same as specifying
  <b>
   -R
  </b>
  on the command line and
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite
  </b>
  will be removed once all the rewriting has been done.
 </p>
 <p>
  By default all possible archives will be merged.  The
  <b>
   -o
  </b>
  option reinstates the old behaviour in which only yesterday's archives
will be considered as merge candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the special case where only a single input archive
needs to be merged,
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogmv.1.html">
    pmlogmv
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

is used to rename the archive, otherwise
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger_merge.1.html">
    pmlogger_merge
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

is used to merge all of the archives for a single host and a single day into a new
PCP archive and the individual archives are removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -M
  </b>
  option may be used to disable archive merging (or renaming) and rewriting
(
  <b>
   -M
  </b>
  implies
  <b>
   -r
  </b>
  ).

This is most useful in cases where the archives are being incrementally
copied to a remote repository, e.g. using
  <b>
   <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html">
    rsync
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).

Merging, renaming and rewriting all risk an increase in the synchronization
load, especially immediately after
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  has run, so
  <b>
   -M
  </b>
  may be useful in these cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  To assist with debugging or diagnosing intermittent failures the
  <b>
   -t
  </b>
  option may be used.  This will turn on very verbose tracing (
  <b>
   -VV
  </b>
  )

and capture the trace output in a file named
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/daily.
  </b>
  <i>
   datestamp
  </i>
  <b>
   .trace,
  </b>
  where
  <i>
   datestamp
  </i>
  is the time
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  was run in the format YYYYMMDD.HH.MM.
In addition, the
  <i>
   want
  </i>
  argument will ensure that trace files created with
  <b>
   -t
  </b>
  will be kept for
  <i>
   want
  </i>
  days and then discarded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, if the
PCP ``notices'' file (
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES
  </b>
  )

is larger than 20480 bytes,
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  will rename the file with a ``.old'' suffix, and start
a new ``notices'' file.
The rotate threshold may be changed from 20480 to
  <i>
   size
  </i>
  bytes using the
  <b>
   -s
  </b>
  option.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use of the
  <b>
   -m
  </b>
  option causes
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  to construct a summary of the ``notices'' file entries which were
generated in the last 24 hours, and e-mail that summary to the set of
space-separated
  <i>
   addresses
  </i>
  .

This daily summary is stored in the file
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES.daily
  </b>
  ,

which will be empty when no new ``notices'' entries were made in the previous
24 hour period.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the
  <b>
   -K
  </b>
  option is specified for
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  then only the compression tasks are attempted, so no
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html">
    pmlogger
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

rotation, no culling, no rewriting, etc.
When
  <b>
   -K
  </b>
  is used and a
  <i>
   compress
  </i>
  value of
  <b>
   0
  </b>
  is in effect
(from
  <b>
   -x
  </b>
  on the command line or
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSAFTER
  </b>
  in the environment or via the
  <i>
   control
  </i>
  file)
this is intended for environments where compression
of archives is desired before the scheduled daily processing
happens.
To achieve this, once
  <b>
   pmlogger_check
  </b>
  has completed regular processing, it calls
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  with just the
  <b>
   -K
  </b>
  option.
Provided
  <b>
   PCP_COMPRESSAFTER
  </b>
  is set to
  <b>
   0
  </b>
  along with any other required compression options to match the
scheduled invocation of
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  ,

then this will compress all volumes except the ones being currently
written by
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html">
    pmlogger
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).
 </p>
 <p>
  If the
  <b>
   -p
  </b>
  option is specified for
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  then the status of the daily processing is polled and if the
daily
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html">
    pmlogger
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

rotation, culling, rewriting, compressing, etc.
has not been done in the last 24 hours then it is done now.
The intent is to have
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  called regularly with the
  <b>
   -p
  </b>
  option (at 30 mins past the hour, every hour in the default
  <b>
   <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html">
    cron
   </a>
  </b>
  (8)

set up) to ensure daily processing happens as soon as possible if
it was missed at the regularly scheduled time (which is 00:10
by default), e.g. if the system was down or suspended at that
time.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the
  <b>
   -p
  </b>
  option,
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  simply exits if the previous day's processing has already been
done.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -K
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   -p
  </b>
  options to
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  are mutually exclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  The script
  <b>
   $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  could be copied and modified to implement a site-specific procedure for
end-of-week and/or end-of-month management for a set of PCP archives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   pmlogger_check
  </b>
  may be run at any time, and is intended to check that the desired set
of
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html">
    pmlogger
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

processes are running, and if not to re-launch any failed loggers.
Use of the
  <b>
   -s
  </b>
  option provides the reverse functionality, allowing the set of
  <b>
   pmlogger
  </b>
  processes to be cleanly shutdown.
Use of the
  <b>
   -C
  </b>
  option queries the system service runlevel information for
  <b>
   pmlogger
  </b>
  ,

and uses that to determine whether to start processes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   -T
  </b>
  option provides a terser form of output for
  <b>
   pmlogger_check
  </b>
  that is most suitable for a
  <i>
   pmlogger
  </i>
  ``farm'' where many instances of
  <i>
   pmlogger
  </i>
  are expected to be running.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using
  <b>
   -N
  </b>
  option invokes the scripts in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode where the
tasks that would be performed are reported, but no changes are made.
This is typically used for debugging in combination with one (verbose)
or two (very verbose)
  <b>
   -V
  </b>
  options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both
  <b>
   pmlogger_daily
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   pmlogger_check
  </b>
  are controlled by PCP logger control file(s)
that specifies the
  <b>
   pmlogger
  </b>
  instances to be managed.  The default control file is
  <b>
   $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH
  </b>
  ,

but an alternate may be specified using the
  <b>
   -c
  </b>
  option.
If the directory
  <b>
   $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH
  </b>
  .d

(or
  <i>
   control
  </i>
  .d

from the
  <b>
   -c
  </b>
  option) exists, then the contents of any additional control files therein
will be appended to the main control file (which must exist).
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Warning
  </b>
  :

The
  <b>
   $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH
  </b>
  .d

files must not be writable by any user other than root.
 </p>
 <p>
  The control file(s) should be customized according to the following rules
that define for the current version (1.1)
of the control file format.
 </p>
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   1.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Lines beginning with a ``#'' are comments.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   2.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Lines beginning with a ``$'' are assumed to be
assignments to environment variables in the style of
   <b>
    <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1.html">
     sh
    </a>
   </b>
   (1),

and all text following the ``$'' will be
   <b>
    eval
   </b>
   'ed

by the script reading the control file,
and the corresponding variable exported into the environment.
This is particularly
useful to set and export variables into the environment of
the administrative scripts, e.g.
   <br/>
   <pre>
$ PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20
</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   3.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   There
   <b>
    must
   </b>
   be a version line in the initial control file of the form:
   <br/>
   <pre>
$ version=1.1
</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   4.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   There should be one line in the control file(s)
for each
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance of the form:
   <p>
   </p>
   <pre>
<i>host</i> <b>y</b>|<b>n</b> <b>y</b>|<b>n</b> <i>directory</i> <i>args</i>
</pre>
   <p>
   </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   5.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Fields within a line of the control file(s)
are usually separated by one or more spaces or tabs (although refer to
the description of the
   <i>
    directory
   </i>
   field for some important exceptions).
  </dd>
  <dt>
   6.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The
   <i>
    first
   </i>
   field is the name of the host that is the source of the
performance metrics for this
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   7.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The
   <i>
    second
   </i>
   field indicates if this is a
   <i>
    primary
   </i>
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance (
   <b>
    y
   </b>
   )

or not (
   <b>
    n
   </b>
   ).

Since the primary logger must run on the local host, and there may be
at most one primary logger for a particular host, this field can be
   <b>
    y
   </b>
   for at most one
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance, in which case the host name must be the name of the local host.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   8.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The
   <i>
    third
   </i>
   field indicates if this
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance needs to be started under the control of
   <b>
    <a href="/man/man1/pmsocks.1.html">
     pmsocks
    </a>
   </b>
   (1)

to connect to a
   <b>
    pmcd
   </b>
   through a firewall (
   <b>
    y
   </b>
   or
   <b>
    n
   </b>
   ).
  </dd>
  <dt>
   9.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The
   <i>
    fourth
   </i>
   field is a directory name.  All files
associated with this
   <b>
    pmlogger
   </b>
   instance will be created in this directory,
and this will be the current directory for the execution of
any programs required in the maintenance of those archives.
A useful convention is that primary logger archives for the local host
with hostname
   <i>
    myhost
   </i>
   are maintained in the directory
   <b>
    $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/
   </b>
   <i>
    myhost
   </i>
   (this is where the default

diagnostics are always sent to a log file.
By default, this file is

      or
      <b>

      <b>

If this log file already exists when the script starts, it will be
renamed with a
      <i>
       .prev
      </i>
      suffix (overwriting any log file saved earlier) before diagnostics
are generated to the log file.
The

      <b>
       -t

      execution of the scripts may be extended using the

       -V

      option to the scripts which will enable verbose tracing of their activity.
By default the scripts generate no output unless some error or warning
condition is encountered.

     Environment variables with the prefix

used by PCP.
On each installation, the file

     </b>
     contains the local values for these variables.
The

     variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
