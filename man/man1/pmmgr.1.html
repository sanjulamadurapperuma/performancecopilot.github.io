              unique host-id string is computed for each potential target pmcd from
              specified metric values.  This host-id is also used as a subdirectory
              name for locating daemon data.

              Metrics without instance specifiers mean all instances of that metric.
              These are used to generate the
                 <i>
                  unique
                 </i>

                 server that
                 <b>
                  pmmgr
                 </b>
                 discovers.
              Upon discovery,
              all the metrics/instances named are queried, string values fetched, and
              normalized/concatenated into a single hyphenated printable string.
              The default is the single metric
                 <b>
                  pmcd.hostname
                 </b>
                 ,
              
              which is sufficient if all the hosts discovered have unique
                 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/hostname.2.html">
                  hostname
                 </a>
                 (2).  If
              they don't, you should add other pcp metric specifications to set them apart
              at your site.  The more you add, the longer the host-id string, but the more
              likely that accidental duplication is prevented.
                </dd>
               </dl>
               <p>
                However, it may be desirable for a host-id to also be
                <i>
                 persistent
                </i>
                ,
              
              so that if the target host goes offline and later returns, the new
              host-id matches the previous one, because then old and new histories can be joined.
              This argues against using metrics whose values vary from boot to boot.

              puts a corresponding I/O load on storage, but is most convenient for a
