 <h2>
  INTRODUCTION
 </h2>
 The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a toolkit designed for monitoring
and managing system-level performance.
These services are distributed and scalable
to accommodate the most complex system configurations and performance
problems.
 <p>
  PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited
to) Linux, MacOSX, Solaris and Windows.
From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of
software utility:
 </p>
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <i>
    PCP Collectors
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract
performance data from various sources, for example the operating
system kernel.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <i>
    PCP Monitors
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from
hosts (or archives) that have the
   <i>
    PCP Collector
   </i>
   installed.
Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release,
while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available
separately in the PCP GUI package.
  </dd>
 </dl>
 <p>
  This manual entry describes the high-level features and
options common to most PCP utilities available on all platforms.

 <h2>
  OVERVIEW
 </h2>
 The PCP architecture is distributed in the
sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.
On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance
metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management
system, a web server, an application, etc.
requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
which is responsible for collecting performance
measurements from that domain.
All PMDAs
are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">
   pmcd
  </a>
 </b>
 (1))

on the same host.
 <p>
  Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">
    pmcd
   </a>
  </b>
  (1),

which
acts as a router for requests, by
forwarding requests to the appropriate
PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.
Clients may also access performance data from sets of PCP archives
(created using
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html">
    pmlogger
   </a>
  </b>
  (1))

for retrospective analysis.

 <h3>
  Security philosophy
 </h3>
 PCP redistributes a wealth of performance information within
a host and across its networks.
The following security philosophy underlies the setting of several
 <i>
  defaults
 </i>
 that control how much information is sent and received.
 <p>
  By default, the information exposed by PMCD about a host is
approximately of the same level of confidentiality as available
to a completely unprivileged user on that host.
So, performance data that is available to be
  <i>
   read
  </i>
  completely freely on a machine may be made available by PMCD to
the network.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the host running PMCD and its network is
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  assumed to run only friendly applications.
Therefore,
  <i>
   write
  </i>
  type operations, including from the local host, are not
permitted by default.
 </p>
 <p>
  These defaults may be overridden (expanded or reduced) in several
ways, including by specifying network ACLs in
  <b>
   pmcd.conf
  </b>
  ,

activating non-default PMDAs, or by using PMCD connections
that pass user credentials.
For example, some PMDAs automatically provide greater information
for particular credentialed users or groups.

 <h3>
  Applications
 </h3>
 The following performance monitoring applications are primarily console
based, typically run directly from the command line, and are just a
small subset of the tools available as part of the base PCP package.

   to enable diagnostics and tracing that is most helpful for developers or
when trying to diagnose the misbehaviour of a PCP application.
   <i>

 <p>
  In the absense of a live or archive source of metrics, a heuristic search
for archive logs for the local host can be invoked via the
  <b>
   -O
  </b>
  (or
  <b>
   --origin
  </b>
  )

option.
When using this option without an explicit source of metrics, monitor
tools attempt to use archives from a system archive location such as
  <b>
   $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/`hostname`
  </b>
  .

Refer to the
  <b>
   TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION
  </b>
  section below for details on the acceptable syntax for the origin
option, but a typical invocation in this mode would be
  <b>
   -O today
  </b>
  or
  <b>
   --origin yesterday
  </b>
  .

 <h2>
  INTERVAL SPECIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT
 </h2>
 Most PCP tools operate with periodic sampling or
reporting, and the
 <b>
  -t
 </b>
 (or
 <b>
  --interval
 </b>
 )

and
 <b>
  -A
 </b>
 (or
 <b>
  --align
 </b>
 )

options may be used to control the duration of the sample interval
and the alignment of the sample times.
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    -t
   </b>
   <i>
    interval

   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     Set the update or reporting interval.
     <p>
      The
      <i>
       interval
      </i>
      argument
is specified as a sequence of one or more elements of the form
     </p>
     <pre>
<i>number</i>[<i>units</i>]
</pre>
     where
     <i>
      number
     </i>
     is an integer or floating point constant (parsed using
     <b>
      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtod.3.html">
       strtod
      </a>
     </b>
     (3))

and the optional
     <i>

     is one of:
     <b>
      seconds

     </b>
     ,
     <b>
      s

     <b>
      days
     </b>
     ,
     <b>
      day
     </b>
     and
     <b>

If the
     <i>
      unit
     </i>
     is empty,
     <b>
      second
     </b>
     is assumed.
     <p>
      In addition, the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of the
above is also acceptable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spaces anywhere in the
      <i>
       interval
      </i>
      are ignored, so
      <b>
       4 days 6 hours 30 minutes
      </b>
      ,
      <b>
       4day6hour30min
      </b>
      ,
      <b>

      </b>
      and
      <b>
       4d6.5h
      </b>
      are all equivalent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multiple specifications are additive,
for example ``
      <b>
       1hour 15mins 30secs
      </b>
      ''
is interpreted as 3600+900+30 seconds.

     By default samples are not necessarily aligned on
any natural unit of time.
The
     <b>
      -A
     </b>
     or
     <b>
      --align
     </b>
     option may be used to force the initial sample to be aligned on the
boundary of a natural time unit.
For example
     <b>
      -A 1sec
     </b>
     ,
     <b>
      -A 30min
     </b>
     and
     <b>
      --align 1hour
     </b>
     specify alignment on whole seconds, half and whole hours respectively.
     <p>
      The
      <i>
       align
      </i>
      argument follows the syntax for an
      <i>
       interval
      </i>
      argument described above for the
      <b>
       -t
      </b>
      or
      <b>
       --interval
      </b>
      option.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that alignment occurs by advancing the time as required, and that
      <b>
       -A
      </b>
      (or
      <b>
       --align
      </b>
      )

acts as a modifier to advance both the start of the time window
(see the next section)
and the origin time (if the
      <b>
       -O
      </b>
      or
      <b>
       --origin
      </b>
      option is specified).

 <h2>
  TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION
 </h2>
 Many PCP tools are designed to operate in some time window of interest,
for example to define a termination time for real-time monitoring or to
define a start and end time within a set of PCP archive logs.
 <p>
  In the absence of the
  <b>
   -O
  </b>
  (or
  <b>
   --origin
  </b>
  )

and
  <b>
   -A
  </b>
  (or
  <b>
   --align
  </b>
  )

options to specify an initial sample time origin
and time alignment (see above), the PCP application
will retrieve the first sample at the start of the time window.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following options may be used to specify a time window of interest.
 </p>
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    -S
   </b>
   <i>
    starttime
   </i>
   ,
   <b>
    --start
   </b>
   =
   <i>
    starttime
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     By default the time window commences immediately in real-time mode,
or coincides with time at the start of the set of PCP archive logs
in archive mode.
The
     <b>
      -S
     </b>
     or
     <b>
      --start
     </b>
     option may be used to specify a later time
for the start of the time window.
     <p>
      The
      <i>
       starttime
      </i>
      parameter may be given in one of
three forms (
      <i>
       interval
      </i>
      is the same as for the
      <b>
       -t
      </b>
      or
      <b>
       --interval
      </b>
      option as described above,
      <i>
       datetime
      </i>
      is described below):
     </p>
     <dl compact="">
      <dt>
       <i>
        interval
       </i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       To specify an offset from the current time (in real-time mode) or the
beginning of a set of PCP archives (in archive mode) simply specify the
interval of time as the argument.
For example
       <b>
        -S 30min
       </b>
       will set the start of the time window to be exactly 30 minutes from
now in real-time mode, or exactly 30 minutes from the start of a set
of PCP archives.
      </dd>
      <dt>
       -
       <i>
        interval
       </i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       To specify an offset from the end of a set of PCP archive logs, prefix
the
       <i>
        interval
       </i>
       argument with a minus sign.
In this case, the start of the time window precedes
the time at the end of the set of archives by the given interval.
For example
       <b>
        -S -1hour
       </b>
       will set the start of the time window to be exactly one hour before the
time of the last sample in a set of PCP archive logs.
      </dd>
      <dt>
       @
       <i>
        datetime
       </i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting
timezone) for the start of the time window, use the datetime
syntax preceded by an at sign.
Refer to the datetime description below for detailed information.
      </dd>

    endtime
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     By default the end of the time window is unbounded
(in real-time mode) or aligned with the time at the end of a set of PCP archive
logs (in archive mode).
The
     <b>
      -T
     </b>
     or
     <b>
      --finish
     </b>
     option may be used to specify an earlier time for
the end of the time window.

      The
      <i>
       endtime
      </i>
      parameter may be given in one of
three forms (

       <i>
        interval
       </i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       To specify an offset from the start of the time window
simply use the interval of time as the argument.
For example
       <b>
        -T 2h30m
       </b>
       will set the end of the time window to be 2 hours and 30 minutes after
the start of the time window.

       -
       <i>
        interval
       </i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       To specify an offset back from the time at the end of a set of PCP archive logs,
prefix the
       <i>
        interval
       </i>
       argument with a minus sign.
For example
       <b>
        -T -90m
       </b>
       will set the end of the time window to be 90 minutes before the time of
the last sample in a set of PCP archive logs.

  A date can be one of:

A time can be one of: HH:MM:SS, HH:MM.
HH:MM can use either the 12 hour (via an am or pm suffix) or 24
hour convention.
A day of the week can be a spelled out day of the week, optionally
preceded by an ordinal number such as second tuesday.
A zone is a time zone value as specified by the

   </a>
  </b>

A relative time can be a time unit that is:
preceded by a cardinal number such as 1 year or 2 months,
preceded by one of the time words this or last,
or succeeded by the time word ago.
A relative time can also be one of the time words:
yesterday, today, tomorrow, now.
Examples of datetime strings are:
  <b>
   1996-03-04 13:07:47 EST Mon
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   1996-03-05 14:07:47 EST -1hour
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   Mon Mar  4 13:07:47 1996
  </b>
  ,
  <b>

  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   Mar 4

  ,
  <b>
   Mar
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   13:07:50
  </b>
  or
  <b>
   13:08
  </b>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For any missing low order fields, the default value of 0 is
assumed for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month
and Jan for months.
Hence, the following are equivalent:
  <b>
   --start '@ Mar 1996'
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   --start '@ Mar 1 00:00:00 1996'
  </b>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by
starting with the
year, month and day from the current time (real-time mode) or
the time at the beginning of the set of PCP archive logs (archive mode)
and advancing the
time until it matches the fields that are specified.
So, for example if the time window starts by default at
``Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'',
then
  <b>
   --start @13:10
  </b>
  corresponds to 13:10:00 on Mon Mar 4, 1996,
while
  <b>
   --start @10:00
  </b>
  corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue Mar 5, 1996 (note this is the
following day).

 <p>
  If a timezone is not included in a
  <i>

  </i>
  then there ares several interpretations available depending
on the other command line options used.
The default is to use the local timezone on the system where

 <h2>
  PERFORMANCE METRICS - IDENTIFIERS, NAMES, VALUES
 </h2>
 The number of performance metric names supported by PCP on most
platforms ranges from many hundreds to several thousand.
The PCP libraries and applications use an internal
identification scheme that unambiguously associates a single
integer with each known performance metric.
This integer is known as the Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID.
Although not a requirement,
PMIDs tend to have global consistency across
all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has the same
PMID.
 <p>
  For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be
inappropriate (this would limit the range of accessible metrics, make
the code hard to maintain, force the user interface to be particularly
baroque, and so on).
Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is used to provide
external names and a hierarchic classification for performance metrics.
A PMNS is represented as a tree, with each node having a label, a
pointer to either a PMID (for leaf nodes) or a set of descendent
nodes in the PMNS (for non-leaf nodes).
 </p>
 <p>
  A node label must begin with
an alphabetic character, followed by zero or more characters drawn
from the alphabetics, the digits and character ``_'' (underscore).
For alphabetic characters in a node label, upper and lower case are
distinguished.
 </p>
 <p>
  By convention, the name of a performance metric is constructed by
concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS from the
root node to a leaf node, with a ``.'' as a separator.
The root node in
the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label associated
with one of the descendent nodes below the root node of the PMNS,
for example
  <i>
   kernel.percpu.syscall.
  </i>
  Typically (although this is not a requirement)
there would be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS.
For example
  <i>
   kernel.all.cpu.idle
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   disk.dev.read
  </i>
  are the unique names for two distinct performance
metrics, each with a unique PMID.
 </p>
 <p>
  Groups of related PMIDs may be named
by naming a non-leaf node in the PMNS tree, for example
  <i>
   disk
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The default local PMNS used by
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  is located at
  <b>
   $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root
  </b>
  however the environment
variable
  <b>
   PMNS_DEFAULT
  </b>
  may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will
then be used as the default local PMNS.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most applications do not use the local PMNS directly,
but rather import parts of the PMNS as required from the
same place that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">
    pmcd
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

for live monitoring or from a set of PCP archives for retrospective
monitoring.
 </p>
 <p>
  To explore the PMNS
use
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pminfo.1.html">
    pminfo
   </a>
  </b>
  (1),

or if the PCP GUI package is installed the New Chart and Metric Search
windows within
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmchart.1.html">
    pmchart
   </a>
  </b>
  (1).
 </p>
 <p>
  Some performance metrics have a singular value.
For example, the available memory or number of context switches
have one value per performance metric source, that is, one value
per host.
The metric descriptor (metadata) for each metric makes this fact
known to applications that process values for these single-valued
metrics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some performance metrics have a set of values or
  <i>
   instances
  </i>
  in each implementing performance metric domain.
For example, one value for each disk, one value for each process,
one value for each CPU, or one value for each activation of a
given application.
When a metric has multiple instances, the PMNS does not represent
this in metric names; rather, a single metric may have an associated
set of values.
Multiple values are associated with the members of an
  <i>
   instance domain
  </i>
  ,

such that each instance has a unique instance identifier within
the associated instance domain.
For example, the ''per CPU´´ instance domain may use the instance
identifiers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on to identify the configured processors
in the system.
Internally, instance identifiers are encoded as binary values, but each
performance metric domain also supports corresponding strings as external
names for the instance identifiers, and these names are used at the user
interface to the PCP utilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Multiple performance metrics may be associated with a single instance domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  PCP arranges for information describing instance domains to be exported
from the performance metric domains to the applications that require
this information.
Applications may also choose to retrieve values for all instances of a
performance metric, or some arbitrary subset of the available instances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metric names and the instance domain concept provides two-dimensions for
the modelling of performance metrics.
This is a clear and simple model, however on some occassions it does not
suffice.
For example, a metric may wish to represent higher dimensional data
such as ``per CPU'' counters for each running process.
In these cases it is common to create a compound instance, where the
name is composed of each component with a separator in-between (for
example, ``87245::cpu7'' might be used to separate process ID from
CPU ID) to create flattened instance names.
Additionally, such cases benefit from the use of metric instances
labels to explicitly show the separate components (continuing the
example from above, labels ``{"pid":87245,"cpu":7}'' might be used).

 <h2>
  PERFORMANCE METRIC SPECIFICATIONS
 </h2>
 In configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line options,
metric specifications adhere to the following syntax rules by most tools.
 <p>
  If the source of performance metrics is real-time from
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">

  components are all optional.
 </p>
 <p>
  The

may be replaced by white space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Special characters in
  <i>

the character with a backslash.
 </p>
 <p>
  White space is ignored everywhere except within a quoted
  <i>

  name.
 </p>
 <p>
  An empty
  <i>
   instance
  </i>
  is silently ignored, and in particular
``
  <b>
   []
  </b>
  '' is the same as no
  <i>
   instance
  </i>
  ,

while ``
  <b>
   [one,,,two]

the two instances ``

 </p>
 <p>
  As a special case, if the

 <h2>
  SECURE PMCD CONNECTIONS
 </h2>
 Since PCP version 3.6.11, a monitor can explicitly request
a secure connection to a collector host running
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">
   pmcd
  </a>
 </b>
 (1)

or
 <b>
  <a href="/man/man1/pmproxy.1.html">
   pmproxy
  </a>
 </b>
 (1)

using the PM_CTXFLAG_SECURE context flag.
If the PCP Collector host supports this feature - refer to the
pmcd.feature.secure metric for confirmation of this - a TLS/SSL
(Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer) connection
can be established which uses public key cryptography and related
techniques.
These features aim to prevent eavesdropping and data tampering
from a malicious third party, as well as providing server-side
authentication (confident identification of a server by a client)
which can be used to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.
 <p>
  A secure
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  connection requires use of certificate-based authentication.
The security features offered by
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   pmproxy
  </b>
  are implemented using the Network Security Services (NSS) APIs and
utilities.
The NSS
  <b>
   certutil
  </b>
  tool can be used to create certificates suitable for establishing
trust between PCP monitor and collector hosts.

 <h2>
  PMCD HOST SPECIFICATION
 </h2>
 In the absence of an explicit hostname specification, most tools
will default to the local host in live update mode.
In PCP releases since 3.8.4 onward, this results in an efficient
local protocol being selected - typically a Unix domain socket.
If this option is used (which can also be explicitly requested
via the
 <i>
  unix:
 </i>
 host specification described below), it is important to note that all
connections will be automatically authenticated.
In other words, the credentials of the user invoking a client tool will

daemon can of course also be provided to request a remote host be used.
The most basic form of
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  host specification is a simple host name, possibly including the
domain name if necessary.
However, this can be extended in a number of ways to further refine
attributes of the connection made to
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  port number and also optional
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmproxy.1.html">
    pmproxy
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

hostname and its port number, can be given as part of the host
specification, since PCP version 3.0.
These supersede (and override) the old-style PMCD_PORT, PMPROXY_HOST
and PMPROXY_PORT environment variables.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following are valid hostname specifications that specify connections to
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  on host
  <i>
   nas1.acme.com
  </i>
  with/without a list of ports, with/without a
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmproxy.1.html">
    pmproxy
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

connection through a firewall, and with IPv6 and IPv4 addresses as shown.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>
$ pcp --host nas1.acme.com:44321,<a href="mailto:4321@firewall.acme.com">4321@firewall.acme.com</a>:44322

$ pcp --host [fe80::2ad2:44ff:fe88:e4f1%p2p1]
$ pcp --host 192.168.0.103
</pre>
 <p>
  In addition, ``connection attributes'' can also be specified.
These include username, password (can be given interactively
and may depend on the authentication mechanism employed),
whether to target a specific running container, whether to use
secure (encrypted) or native (naked) protocol, and so on.
The previous examples all default to native protocol, and use
no authentication.
This can be altered, as in the following examples.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>
$ pcp --host <a href="pcps://app2.acme.com?container=cae8e6edc0d5">pcps://app2.acme.com?container=cae8e6edc0d5</a>
$ pcp --host <a href="pcps://nas1.acme.com:44321?username=tanya">pcps://nas1.acme.com:44321?username=tanya</a>&amp;method=gssapi
$ pcp --host <a href="pcps://nas2.acme.com@firewalls.r.us?method=plain">pcps://nas2.acme.com@firewalls.r.us?method=plain</a>

$ pcp --host unix:
$ pcp --host local:
</pre>
 <p>
  The choice of authentication method, and other resulting parameters like
username, optionally password, etc, depends on the SASL2 configuration
used by each (remote)
  <b>
   pmcd
  </b>
  .

Tutorials are available specifying various aspects of configuring the
authentication module(s) used, these fine details are outside the scope
of this document.
 </p>
 <p>
  In all situations, host names can be used interchangeably with IPv4 or IPv6
addressing (directly), as shown above.
In the case of an IPv6 address, the full address must be enclosed by
square brackets and the scope (interface) must also be specified.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final
  <i>
   local:
  </i>
  example above is now the default for most tools.
This connection is an automatically authenticated local host connection
on all platforms that support Unix domain sockets.
No password is required and authentication is automatic.
This is also the most efficient (lowest overhead) communication channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The difference between
  <i>
   unix:
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   local:
  </i>
  is that the former is a strict Unix domain socket specification (connection
fails if it cannot connect that way),
whereas the latter has a more forgiving fallback to using
  <i>
   localhost
  </i>
  (i.e. a regular Inet socket connection is used when Unix domain socket
connections are unavailable).

the connection attempt
could potentially block for a long time until the remote machine
finishes its initialization.
Most PCP applications and some of the PCP library routines
will abort and return an error if the connection has not been established after
some specified interval has elapsed.
The default interval is 5 seconds.
This may be modified by setting
   <b>
    PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT

However, attempts to reconnect are controlled by a back-off
strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection
requests.
By default, the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80

(the last delay will be repeated for any further
attempts after the fifth).
Setting the environment variable

   to a comma separated list of positive integers will re-define
the back-off delays, for example setting

Under some circumstances, one value of these metrics may smaller

This can happen when a counter of finite precision overflows, or

there is a remote possibility of

   "hanging" on a request

variable

   to a number of seconds, requests to

The default behavior is to be willing to wait forever for a response
from each request to a

When used,

  PCP ENVIRONMENT
 </h2>
 Environment variables with the prefix
 <b>
  PCP_

 are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file
 <i>
  /etc/pcp.conf
 </i>
 contains the local values for these variables.
The
 <b>
  $PCP_CONF
