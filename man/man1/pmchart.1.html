 <h2>
  DESCRIPTION
 </h2>
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics values
available through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).
Multiple charts can be displayed simultaneously, either aligned
on the unified time axis (X-axis), and through the use of multiple
interface Tabs.
 <p>
  Metric values can be sourced from one or more live hosts
(simultaneously).
Alternatively, one or more sets of PCP archives
can be used as a source of historical data.
See
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pcpintro.1.html">
    PCPIntro
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

for an in-depth discussion of the capabilities of the PCP
framework, many of which are used by
  <b>
   pmchart.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Many aspects of the behaviour of
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  can be customised through the interface.
In particular, the use of "views" (refer to the section describing
VIEWS later in this document)
allows predefined sets of metrics and charting parameters
like colors, scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be stored for
later use, or use with different hosts and sets of archives.
In addition, the Preferences dialog allows customisations to the
rest of the
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  user interface to be saved and restored between different invocations
of the tool.
This allows the default background color, highlight color, contents
and location of the toolbar, and many other aspects to be configured.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  makes extensive use of the
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmtime.1.html">
    pmtime
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

utility for time control, refer to the
  <b>
   pmtime
  </b>
  manual page for further details of its operation.

 <h2>
  OPTIONS
 </h2>
 The available command line options are:
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   <b>
    -a
   </b>
   <i>
    archive
   </i>
   ,
   <b>
    --archive
   </b>
   =
   <i>
    archive
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) archive logs identified by this option, by default.
The argument is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the
base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
archives.
The resulting set of archives will be the source of the performance metrics.
The initial Tab created will be an archive mode Tab.
Multiple
   <b>
    -a
   </b>
   options can be presented, and the resulting list of sets of archives is used
for sourcing metric values.
Any
   <i>
    sources
   </i>
   listed on the command line are assumed to be sets of archives
if this option is used.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    -A
   </b>
   <i>
    align
   </i>
   ,
   <b>
    --align
   </b>
   =
   <i>
    align
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Force the initial sample to be
aligned on the boundary of a natural time unit
   <i>
    align
   </i>
   .

Refer to

   ,
   <b>
    --view
   </b>
   =
   <i>
    configfile
   </i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <i>
    configfile
   </i>
   specifies an initial view to load, using the default source of metrics.
Multiple
   <b>
    -c
   </b>
   views can be specified, and they will all be opened in the
default Tab with the default source of metrics.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    -c
   </b>
   ,
   <b>
    --check
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Used with
   <b>
    -c
   </b>
   ,

the view(s) are parsed, any errors are reported, and the tool exits.
This is primarily intended for testing purposes.
If a second
   <b>
    -C
   </b>
   option is presented,
   <b>
    pmchart
   </b>
   also connects to
   <b>
    <a href="/man/man1/pmcd.1.html">
     pmcd
    </a>
   </b>
   (1)

to check the semantics of metrics.

  <dd>
   Specify the default font
   <i>
    family
   </i>
   to be used in several chart components,
such as the chart title, legend, and Y-axis label.
The default value is "Sans Serif".
This setting does not affect the rest of the user interface, where
the value is inherited from the environment in which
   <b>
    pmchart
   </b>
   operates, and differs according to the look-and-feel of each
platform.

  <dd>
   Specify the default font
   <i>
    point
   </i>
   size to be used in several chart components,
such as the chart title, legend, and Y-axis label.
The default is platform dependent, but is either 7, 8 or 9.
This setting does not affect the rest of the user interface.

 <h2>
  VIEWS
 </h2>
 The primary
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 configuration file is the "view", which allows the metadata
associated with one or more charts to be saved in the filesystem.
This metadata describes all aspects of the charts, including
which PCP metrics and instances are to be used, which hosts, which
colors, the chart titles, use of chart legends, and much more.
 <p>
  From a conceptual point of view, there are two classes of view.
These views share the same configuration file format - refer
to a later section for a complete description of this format.
The differences lie in where they are installed and how they
are manipulated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first class, the "system" view, is simply any view that is
installed as part of the
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  package.
These are stored in
  <i>
   $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmchart.
  </i>
  When the
  <i>
   File→Open View
  </i>
  dialog is displayed, it is these views that are initially listed.
The system views cannot be modified by a normal user, and should
not be modified even by a user with suitable privileges, as they
will be overwritten during an upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second class of view is the "user" view.
These views are created on-the-fly using the
  <i>
   File→Save View
  </i>
  dialog.
This is a mechanism for individual users to save their commonly
used views.
Access to these views is achieved through the
  <i>
   File→Open View
  </i>
  dialog, as with the system views.
Once the dialog is opened, the list of views can be toggled between
user and system views by clicking on the two toggle buttons in the
top right corner.
User views are stored in
  <i>
   $HOME/.pcp/pmchart.
  </i>
  <a name="lbAG">
  </a>
 </p>
 <h2>
  TABS
 </h2>
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 provides the common user interface concept of the Tab, which
is most prevalent in modern web browsers.
Tabs allow
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 to update many more charts than the available screen real estate
allows, by providing a user interface mechanism to stack (and
switch between) different vertical sets of charts.
Switching between Tabs is achieved by clicking on the Tab labels,
which are located along the top of the display beneath the Menu
and Tool bars).
 <p>
  Each Tab has a mode of operation (either live or archive -
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  can support both modes simultaneously), the total number of
samples and currently visible points, and a label describing
the Tab which is displayed at the top of the
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  window.
New Tabs can be created using the
  <i>
   File→Add Tab
  </i>
  dialog.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to save on vertical screen real estate, note that the user
interface element for changing between different Tabs (and its label)
are only displayed when more than one Tab exists.
A Tab can be dismissed using the
  <i>
   File→Close Tab
  </i>
  menu, which removes the current Tab and any charts it contained.
  <a name="lbAH">
  </a>
 </p>
 <h2>
  IMAGES and PRINTING
 </h2>
 A static copy of the currently displayed vertical series of charts
can be captured in two ways.
 <p>
  When the intended display device is the screen, the
  <i>
   File→Export
  </i>
  menu option should be used.
This allows exporting the charts in a variety of image formats,
including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.
The image size can be scaled up or down in any dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, when the intended display device is paper, the
  <i>
   File→Print
  </i>
  menu option can be used.
This supports the usual set of printing options (choice of printer,
grayscale/color, landscape/portrait, scaling to different paper sizes,
etc),
and in addition allows printing to the intermediate printer formats
of PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF).

 <h2>
  RECORDING
 </h2>
 It is possible to make a recording of a set of displayed charts,
for later playback through
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 or any of the other Performance Co-Pilot tools.
The
 <i>
  Record→Start
 </i>
 functionality is simple to configure through the user interface,
and allows fine-tuning of the recording process (including record
frequencies that differ to the
 <b>
  pmchart
 </b>
 update interval, alternate file locations, etc).
 <p>
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  produces recordings that are compatible with the PCP
  <b>
   <a href="/man/man1/pmafm.1.html">
    pmafm
   </a>
  </b>
  (1)

replay mechanism, for later playback via a new instance of
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  .

In addition, when recording through
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  one can also replay the recording immediately, as on termination
of the recording (through the
  <i>
   Record→Stop
  </i>
  menu item), an archive mode Tab will be created with the captured view.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once recording is active in a Live Tab, the Time Control status
button in the bottom left corner of the
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  window is displayed with a distinctive red dot.
At any time during a
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  recording session, the amount of space used in the filesystem by
that recording can be displayed using the
  <i>
   Record→Query
  </i>
  menu item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the
  <i>
   Record→Detach
  </i>
  menu option provides a mechanism whereby the recording process can
be completely divorced from the running
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  process, and allowed to continue on when
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  exits.
A dialog displaying the current size and estimated rate of growth for
the recording is presented.
On the other hand, if
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  is terminated while recording is in process, then the recording process
will prompt the user to choose immediate cessation of recording or for
it to continue on independently.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of the record mode services available from
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  are implemented with the assistance of the base Performance Co-Pilot
logging services - refer to

 <h2>
  CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
 </h2>
 <p>
  <b>
   pmchart
  </b>
  loads predefined chart configurations (or "views") from external
files that conform to the following rules.
In the descriptions below
keywords (shown in bold) may appear in upper, lower or
mixed case, elements shown in
  <tt>
   [stuff]
  </tt>
  are optional, and
user-supplied elements are shown as
  <tt>
   &lt;other stuff&gt;
  </tt>
  .
A vertical bar (|) is used where syntactic elements are alternatives.
Quotes (")
may be used to enclose lexical elements that may contain white space,
such as titles, labels and instance names.
 </p>
 <dl compact="">
  <dt>
   1.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The first line defines the configuration file type and should be
   <pre>
#kmchart

<br/>
</pre>
   although
   <b>
    pmchart
   </b>
   provides backwards compatibility for the older
   <b>
    pmchart
   </b>
   view formats with an initial line of
   <pre>
#pmchart

<br/>
</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   2.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   After the first line, lines beginning with "#" as the first
non-white space character are treated as comments and skipped.
Similarly blank lines are skipped.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   3.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   The next line should be
   <pre>
version &lt;n&gt; &lt;host-clause&gt;

<br/>
</pre>
   where
   <tt>
    &lt;n&gt;
   </tt>
   depends on the configuration file type, and
is 1 for pmchart else 1.1, 1.2 or
2.0 for pmchart.
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     The
     <tt>
      &lt;host-clause&gt;
     </tt>
     part is optional (and ignored)
for
     <b>
      pmchart
     </b>
     configuration
files, but required for the
     <b>
      pmchart
     </b>
     configuration files, and
is of the form
     <pre>
host literal

<br/>
</pre>
     or
     <pre>
host dynamic

<br/>
</pre>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   4.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   A configuration contains one or more charts defined as follows:
   <pre>
chart [title &lt;title&gt;] style &lt;style&gt; &lt;options&gt;

<br/>
</pre>
   If specified, the title will appear centred and above the graph area
of the chart.
The
   <tt>
    &lt;title&gt;
   </tt>
   is usually enclosed in quotes (") and if it
contains the sequence "%h" this will be replaced by the short form
of the hostname for the default source of metrics at the time
this chart was loaded.
Alternatively, "%H" can be used to insert the full host name.
If the hostname appears to be an inet or IPv6 address,
no shortening will be attempted; it will be used as-is in
both replacement cases.
After the view is loaded, the title visibility and setting
can be manipulated using the
   <i>
    Chart Title
   </i>
   text box in the
   <i>
    Edit→Chart
   </i>
   dialog.
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      The
      <tt>
       &lt;style&gt;
      </tt>
      controls the initial plotting style of the chart, and
should be one of the keywords plot (line graph), bar,
stacking (stacked bar),
area or utilization.
After the view is loaded, the plotting style can be changed using the
      <i>
       Edit→Chart
      </i>
      Style dropdown list.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <tt>
       &lt;options&gt;
      </tt>
      are zero or more of the optional elements:
     </p>
     <pre>
[scale [from] &lt;ymin&gt; [to] &lt;ymax&gt;] [legend &lt;onoff&gt;]

<br/>
</pre>
     If scale is specified, the vertical scaling is set for all plots
in the chart to a y-range defined by
     <tt>
      &lt;ymin&gt;
     </tt>
     and
     <tt>
      &lt;ymax&gt;
     </tt>
     .
Otherwise the
vertical axis will be autoscaled based on the values currently being
plotted.
     <p>
      <tt>
       &lt;onoff&gt;
      </tt>
      is one of the keywords on or off and the
legend clause controls the presence or absence of the plot
legend below the graph area.
The default is for the legend to be shown.
After the view is loaded, the legend visibility
can be toggled using the
      <i>
       Show Legend
      </i>
      button in the
      <i>
       Edit→Chart
      </i>
      dialog.

   </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>
   5.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <b>
    pmchart
   </b>
   supports a global clause to specify the dimensions of the
top-level window (using the width and height keywords),
the number of visible points (points keyword) and the starting
X and Y axis positions on the screen (xpos and ypos
keywords).
Each of these global attributes takes an integer value as the
sole qualifier.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   6.
  </dt>
  <dd>
   Each chart has one or more plots associated with it, as
defined by one of the following specifications:
   <pre>
plot
    [legend &lt;title&gt;] [color &lt;colorspec&gt;] [host &lt;hostspec&gt;]
    metric &lt;metricname&gt;
    [ instance &lt;inst&gt; | matching &lt;pat&gt; | not-matching &lt;pat&gt; ]

<br/>
</pre>
   <dl compact="">
    <dt>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      The keyword plot may be replaced with the keyword
optional-plot, in which case if the source of performance data
does not include the specified performance metric and/or instance,
then this plot is silently dropped from the chart.
     </p>
     <p>
      If specified, the title will appear in the chart legend.
The
      <tt>
       &lt;title&gt;
      </tt>
      is usually enclosed in quotes (") and it may
contain one or more wildcard characters which will be expanded
using metric name, instance name, and host name for the plot.
The wildcards are "%i" (short unique instance name, up to the first
whitespace), "%I" (full instance name), "%h" (short host name, up
to the first dot), %H (full host name), "%m" (metric name shortened
to the final two PMNS components), and "%M" (full metric name).
     </p>
     <p>
      For older
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      configuration files, the keyword title must be used instead of
legend.
Nowadays
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      supports either keyword.
     </p>
     <p>
      The color clause is optional for newer
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      configuration files, but it was mandatory in the original
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      configuration file format.
      <tt>
       &lt;colorspec&gt;
      </tt>
      may be one of the following:
     </p>
     <pre>
#-cycle
rgbi:rr:gg:bb
#rgb
#rrggbb
#rrrgggbbb
#rrrrggggbbbb
&lt;Xcolor&gt;

<br/>
</pre>
     where each of
     <tt>
      r
     </tt>
     ,
     <tt>
      g
     </tt>
     and
     <tt>
      b
     </tt>
     are hexadecimal
digits (0-9 and A-F) representing respectively the red, green and
blue color components.
     <tt>
      &lt;Xcolor&gt;
     </tt>
     is one of the color names from the X color database,
e.g. red or steelblue, see also the output from
     <b>
      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/showrgb.1.html">
       showrgb
      </a>
     </b>
     (1).
     <p>
      The "color" #-cycle specifies that
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      should use the next in a pallet of colors that it uses cyclically
for each chart.
This is the default if the color clause is omitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <tt>
       &lt;hostspec&gt;
      </tt>
      in the host clause may be a hostname,
an IP address or an asterisk (*); the latter is used to mean the
default source of performance metrics.
For older
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      configuration files, the host clause must be present, for new
      <b>
       pmchart
      </b>
      configuration files it is optional, and if missing the default source
of performance metrics will be used.
     </p>
     <p>
      The optional instance specification,
     </p>
     <dl compact="">
      <dt>
       (a)
      </dt>
      <dd>
       is omitted in which case one plot will be created for every instance of
the

  <dt>
   7.

   The optional tab directive can be used to create views with
multiple charts which span multiple Tabs.
The syntax is as follows:
   <pre>
tab &lt;label&gt; [host &lt;host&gt;] [points &lt;points&gt; [samples &lt;samples&gt;]]

</pre>
   <dl compact="">
